# Lindenmayer (L-systems)

L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a
Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.
Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model
the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to
model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate
self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.
