# Lindenmayer (L-systems)

L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a
Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.
Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model
the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to
model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate
self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.

In this module, a Lindenmayer System (LSystem) object consists of:

- Rules:
    a dictionary of transformation rules that
    replace a character with one or more

- Initial state:
    the initial state for the system (also called "the Axiom")

- State:
    the current evolved state (initially empty, added when the system is evaluated)

You  can define an L-System like this:

    koch = LSystem(Dict("F" => "F+F--F+F"), "F")

The State is actually stored as an array of integers (I thought it would
probably be faster than very long strings — about half a million is typical —
although I didn't test it), but the rules and initial state are stored as
strings.

To draw the LSystems, we can use a Turtle, as in Turtle Graphics. Each individual
character used is assigned a sequence of one or more graphics commands. For
example, "F" converts to "Forward()". This is hard-coded in the `render()` function.
Graphics are currently provided by Luxor.jl.

To evaluate and draw a Lindenmayer system, use one of the following forms:

    drawLSystem(lsystem::LSystem)
    drawLSystem(lsystem::LSystem, forward=30, turn=45, iterations=6)
    drawLSystem(lsystem::LSystem, filename="/tmp/lsystem.pdf")

— there are lots of options...

Another example:

    hilbert = LSystem(Dict(
        "L" => "+RF-LFL-FR+",
        "R" => "-LF+RFR+FL-"),
        "L")
    drawLSystem(hilbert, forward=5, turn=90, iterations=6, filename="/tmp/hilbert.pdf")
